An interactive command-line tool to query the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of Python code using a simple, powerful query language. It's like `grep` or `SQL` for your code's structure.

## The Problem
Static analysis, linting, and codemodding all rely on understanding and navigating a program's Abstract Syntax Tree. However, exploring the AST to find specific structural patterns is often a cumbersome, non-interactive process. AST-Query solves this by providing a simple, declarative language to find the exact nodes you're looking for.

## Key Features
- **Simple Query Language:** Use an intuitive syntax to find nodes by type (e.g., `find for_loop`).
- **Powerful Attribute Filtering:** Filter nodes by their attributes using a simple `where` clause (e.g., `where name='my_func'`).
- **Interactive Highlighting:** Pinpoints the exact lines of code that match your query in the terminal.
- **Pure Python:** Built with no dependencies outside the standard library, using Python's powerful `ast` module.
- **Educational:** A great tool for learning how Python's internals work and understanding the structure of your own code.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ast-query.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ast-query.git)
cd ast-query

# (Optional) It is recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
## Usage
To run a query, use the following command structure:
```Bash
python -m ast_query.main <path_to_your_file.py> "find <node_type> [where <attribute>='<value>']"
```

**Example Queries**
Given a file example.py:
```Python
import os

class DataProcessor:
    def process(self, data):
        if not data:
            return None
        
        for item in data:
            print(f"Processing {item}")
        
        return True

def helper_function():
    pass
```

**Find all function definitions:**
```Bash
python -m ast_query.main example.py "find function_def"
```

**Find a specific function by its name:**
```Bash
python -m ast_query.main example.py "find function_def where name='process'"
```

**Find a specific class definition:**
```Bash
python -m ast_query.main example.py "find class_def where name='dataprocessor'"
```
